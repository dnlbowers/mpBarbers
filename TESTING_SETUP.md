To run the comprehensive test suite, you need to install the testing dependencies:

```bash
# Install testing dependencies
yarn add --dev @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/react-hooks @testing-library/user-event jest-axe jest-junit

# Or with npm
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/react-hooks @testing-library/user-event jest-axe jest-junit
```

- `@testing-library/react` - React component testing utilities  
- `@testing-library/react-hooks` - Hook testing utilities
- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation
- `jest-axe` - Accessibility testing (optional but recommended)
- `jest-junit` - JUnit XML reporter for CI/CD

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

After installing dependencies:

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage

# Run tests for CI/CD
yarn test:ci
```
